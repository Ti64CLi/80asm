Greetings!

This is 80asm, a z80 assembler with simple syntax!
This assembler (in theory) can generate code that could be saved to a ROM
and used directly with a Zilog z80 processor.



TODO:
    A 'label' cannot be the last instruction in the assembly file
    Write more example files
    Write tests to make sure opcodes being generated are correct
